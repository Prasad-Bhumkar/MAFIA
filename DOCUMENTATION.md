Additional Technical Considerations
Frontend Implementation:

Use multi-page architecture for distinct views (e.g., /settings, /help).
Images are referenced directly from Pexels (e.g., <img src="https://images.pexels.com/..." alt="..." />).
Animations: Subtle transitions using Tailwind transition and hover:scale-105 utilities.
Backend (Node.js):

Database: Use SQLite3 for local storage (e.g., command history).
Dependencies:
sqlite3 (not better-sqlite3).
axios for API calls.
escape-string-regexp for command sanitization.
Testing:

Unit Tests: Jest tests in __tests__ directory for core modules.
Integration Tests: Mock AIServiceV2.ts responses to avoid API calls during tests.
Security:

CORS: None required since all resources are CDN-based or local.
Data Privacy: Encrypt sensitive data (API keys) using VS Code's built-in encryption.
Performance:

Caching: Use localStorage for frequent UI states (e.g., expanded/collapsed sections).
Lazy Loading: Load heavy components (e.g., history panel) after initial render.
This plan ensures all features from the product design are addressed with clear file-level responsibilities and technical alignment.
